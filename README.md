Iteration 1(Without Dropout Layer) Findings :
After the 6th, 7th Epoch , the difference between the training and Validation accuracy significantly increases, overfitting is evident.

Iteration 2(With Dropout Layer) Findings :
After the model fit, Overfitting has been significantly reduced, however the accuracy (both training and validation) are both very low (61% / 50%)


Iteration 3(Post Rebalancing) Findings :
The validation accuracy has improved dramatically from ~50% to ~88%.
Overfitting has been addressed as the variance between test accuracy and training accuracy has decreased significantly.
